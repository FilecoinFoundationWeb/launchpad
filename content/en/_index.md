Launchpad is a training program that covers web3 topics like: blockchains,
peer-to-peer communication, content addressing, and decentralized file storage.

We have paused the live-guided 4-week program until the economic environment
improves, but the materials remain open for self-guided exploration. Click on
Curriculum in the menu to begin your tour.

For a taste of what the Launchpad program provides, please enjoy the beautiful
demo video to the right. We held classes in Paris, Reykjavik, San Francisco,
Austin and more.
