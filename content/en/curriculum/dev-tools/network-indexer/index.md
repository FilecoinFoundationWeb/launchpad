## <Dev Tool> Introdution
The network indexer is a project created and maintained by Protocol Labs that is designed to index the data on the Filecoin and IPFS networks, and work alongside the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) employed by IPFS and Filecoin to enable the fast and efficient retrieval of content-addressed data.


## Why Use/ Who Uses <Dev Tool>
Protocol Labs' Network Indexer enables any user or developer to query both the IPFS and Filecoin public nodes to find content-addresses data using the [CID](../ipfs/content-addressing/#content-addressing).
Since IPFS and Filecoin use different protocols to retrieve data (IPFS uses Bitsawp, and Filecion uses Graphsync), there is a need for a solution that makes it possible for anyone who would want to retrieve and use that data to locate and understand which protocol they can use to retrieve that data and use it in other applications.
Describe who uses the dev tool (L0 Developer? L2 Developers) and what they work on.
Give some real-world use-cases and examples
