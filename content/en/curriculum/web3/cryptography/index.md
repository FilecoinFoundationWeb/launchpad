## Overview

Cryptography is a set of mathematical techniques that allow communications to be
scrambled in such a way that only those who know the unlocking keys can
unscramble and read the messages. Cryptography undergirds the internet now. It
is to encrypt almost all internet traffic, so only those authorized may view it.

## History

1936

- Alan Turing uses cryptography in computing

Mid-Century

- Cryptography is primarily used for defense purposes

1990s

- Cyberpunks creates Hashcash

2008

- [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is published anonymously
  by Satoshi Nakamoto as an “electronic payment system based on cryptographic
  proof instead of trust.” Bitcoin is widely considered the first major
  innovation in Blockchain history.

2014

- [Ethereum
  whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/669c9e2e2027310b6b3cdce6e1c52962/Ethereum_Whitepaper_-_Buterin_2014.pdf)
  is published 2017 Filecoin whitepaper is published.

## The First Crypto-currencies

eCash is widely considered the first version of internet money followed by
B-money, Bitgold, and Hashcash. All were influential in what we know to be
cryptocurrency today.

In the 90s a small group of hackers who called themselves Cypherpunks were tired
of the government’s power and ability to obstruct people’s privacy as a means of
oppression. The Cypherpunks believed that cryptography would be the tool to
maintain sovereignty of and freedom on the internet.

“We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. [...] We must defend
our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create
systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place.” (A Cypherpunk’s
Manifesto)
