## Overview

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are communities/organizations
organized around a shared set of rules enforced on the blockchain through a
smart contract. Once the contract is live on the network, no one can change the
rules except by a vote. The ethos behind DAOs is to enable collective
decision-making, guard railing against hierarchical organization structures. A
popular analogy is that DAOs are modern-day, tech-enabled coops.

DAO members are not only participants in, but also owners of the DAO. Members
are given tokens which grant them equity ownership in the DAO, as well as voting
power in on-chain governance decisions.

## Core Components

1. Mission. DAOs need a mission/purpose. This can be collecting NFTs, building a
   product, funding public goods, etc.
2. Group chat. DAOs usually start off with a small group of people in Telegram
   group or Discord server that share the same interest(s) or goal(s).
3. Treasury. The most common type of Community DAO collects NFTs and stores them
   in a multi-sig. Community DAOs can also bootstrap their treasury through a
   tokenized crowdfund.
4. Governance. Community DAOs with valuable treasuries and 100+ members need a
   way to make collective decisions. Usually, rough consensus is reached
   off-chain and the governance vote is just a formality. Also, most Community
   DAOs empower small, focused teams of 5-10 members to own specific
   work-streams instead of requiring a governance proposal for every decision.
5. On-chain cash flow. This is the most nascent component of Community DAOs but
   also the most interesting. On-chain cash flow turns a group chat into a
   sustainable business. So far, the most common way to generate on-chain cash
   flow has been through NFT drops.
6. Not core, but relevant:
7. Token. As word gets out about how much fun your Community DAO is having,
   people start blowing up your DMâ€™s begging you to let them in. At this point,
   many Community DAOs issue an ERC-20 token as a way to gate membership.

## Types of DAOs

- Protocol DAO: Networks issue a token, allowing community members to govern the
  protocol
- Grant DAO: Communities donate funds and use a DAO to vote on how capital is
  allocated to various contributors
- Social DAO: exactly what it sounds like, good vibes only
- Investment DAO: Investment DAOs allow members to pool capital and invest in
  projects at their earliest stages
